# Composing a Workflow Plan

The composer's job is to fit the CEREMONY to the TASK: propose the minimum
viable workflow - the least sufficient EXECUTE set that still produces every
artifact the task's outcome depends on. Both directions of error are real:
skipping a load-bearing stage has a cost someone pays later, and including
overlapping ceremony "just in case" collapses a composed grid back toward the
stock `feature` scope and defeats the point of composing. Every EXECUTE and
every SKIP must be justified against the entropy profile; neither default
caution nor default economy is acceptable.

## How to read a task

- **Score before you select.** Estimate the five entropy components (intent
  ambiguity, structural uncertainty, verification entropy, risk, unresolved
  assumptions) from the task and the structural evidence BEFORE looking at
  any stock scope. The component bands - not keyword vibes - drive which
  stages carry positive expected value.
- **Incremental vs net-new.** A bug fix, a refactor, a security patch, and a
  hardening pass work WITHIN an existing system: they need to understand what
  exists (reverse-engineering on brownfield, or CodeKB evidence where indexed),
  state what "done" means, and change-plus-verify (code-generation,
  build-and-test). They do not need market-research, user-stories, or
  domain-design - those discover and shape a product that already exists.
- **Net-new surface.** A new feature, product, or service needs the discovery
  arc: intent-capture, scope-definition, then the inception design stages in
  proportion to how much NEW structure it introduces.
- **Operational outcome.** Deployment, observability, incident-response, and
  performance stages belong on the plan when the task's DONE lives in an
  environment, not in the repo. A plan that builds but never ships closes no
  operational task.
- **Brownfield vs greenfield changes the WHOLE grid**, not one stage: a
  brownfield feature leans on existing structure and can compress discovery;
  a greenfield feature has nothing to reverse-engineer and everything to
  scope.

## Grid discipline

- Every required consume must have its producer on the EXECUTE set (the
  validator enforces it; in-flight strict mode rejects). Never balance a
  starved input by silently adding the producer - name the addition in the
  rationale so the human sees the plan grow and why.
- Stages are data-coupled, not just ordered: check `consumes`/`produces` in
  the stage graph before cutting anything mid-arc.
- Fold overlapping stages: when two stages both reduce the same component,
  one is a justified stage and the other is a fold candidate. Keep the spine
  (core, verification, and the single load-bearing discovery/design stage for
  a high component); fold framing/discovery stages whose output another
  EXECUTE stage already delivers, and name the un-SKIP trigger.
- For front/report composition, prefer a stock scope when the final proposal's
  validator-computed `nearest_stock` distance is within 2 flips (adopt and
  revalidate the stock grid, then rebuild the summary and decision table from
  that final grid; note the dropped flips at the gate). The earlier mechanical
  screen's distance is advisory and never overrides evidence-driven folds. A
  human edit to an adopted stock grid converts it to custom so the edit is
  carried to creation. When no stock scope fits the final proposal, synthesize
  - do not force a bad match.
- Neither route writes a scope file. A custom plan runs on the stock scope the
  validator names (`base_scope`) with its stage changes (`plan_changes`) and,
  when that scope runs another depth, the plan's own (`creation_depth`, from
  the `depth` the proposal names), for this piece of work only, so nothing
  piles up in the scope library. The
  person can keep a plan they like: "Approve and save as scope" at the gate, or
  "save this plan as <name>" later, and the engine writes the scope then.
- In-flight recomposition never adopts a stock scope. Preserve the running
  workflow's scope, depth, and frozen actions, then return only the strict-
  validated pending delta as exact `changes.skip` / `changes.add` arrays for
  the conductor's `recompose` command.

## Guard Policy

Every proposal names ONE Guard Policy value with a 1-2 sentence rationale
naming the fences it lowers and why an input change after approval should
reopen it, or be recorded and continue. The value decides two things: what
happens when an input changes after the human approved or confirmed something,
and how far the automatic checks stand aside for the agents. `strict` lowers
no fences and reopens that approval; `relaxed`
records the change once, tells the human in one line, continues, and stands the
plan-approval and review-freeze checks aside; `off` does that and stands the
state-transition and reviewer-scope checks aside as well. No value removes a
gate and none of them touches human presence. The conductor still asks every
approval question; the value also decides which fences stop undirected work,
and each pass through a lowered fence records a `GUARD_STOOD_ASIDE` row.

- A matched stock scope carries its own default (`guard_policy:` in the
  scope file; the core defaults are strict on enterprise, security-patch,
  and infra, off on express, and relaxed on the other seven; a plugin scope
  uses its own value, read in the order the scope loader reads it:
  `guard_policy:`, then the retired `change_control:`, then strict when
  neither line is present). Adopt it and say so.
- For a custom grid, read the entropy profile the same way the grid was read:
  high risk or verification entropy, regulated work, or several people sharing
  the approvals point to strict; a spike, a fix, or a solo run where every
  changed file would otherwise mean another approval points to relaxed.
  `validate-grid --custom` picks a `base_scope` whose default is that value
  (any stock scope serves strict), so creation carries it.
- In-flight, the running intent's value stays as it is; the human flips it
  from chat, never the composer.
- The human sees the value as its own gate row and can flip it before
  approving a front composition. In-flight, the row is read-only: a
  recompose lands only stage skips and adds, so the proposal names the routes
  (raise or lower by typing `/aidlc --guard-policy <value>`, with `$aidlc` on
  Codex). Changing scope alone never lowers the running policy.
  A memory layer that declares strict wins over any proposal; the
  validator and the intent-create command both refuse a relaxed or off value
  under it.
- Intent creation reads Guard Policy from the scope the plan runs on; the
  conductor passes `--guard-policy` only for `strict`. A flip to `relaxed` or
  `off` on a matched proposal is an edit: convert it to custom and revalidate,
  and the base the validator picks carries the value at creation; no setter
  runs afterwards.

## Scope settings

The grid decides which stages run; five scope settings decide how much
ceremony runs inside them. Every front/report proposal names all five in its
`scopeSettings` member, in the scope file's own words, with a 1-2 sentence
`scopeSettingsRationale`:

| Setting | Values | What turning it down removes |
|---------|--------|------------------------------|
| `sensors` | `on`, `off` | Automatic sensor runs (claim sources, required sections, upstream coverage, traceability, lint, type check) and their gate checks |
| `learnings` | `on`, `off` | The stage learnings read/write ritual |
| `summary_confirmation` | `on`, `off` | The separate "Looks correct" checkpoint before a stage writes its artifacts |
| `plan_approval` | `on`, `off` | The person's approval of each code plan before it is built; off builds the plan as written with one line naming it |
| `review_cap` | `adversarial`, `advisory`, `none` | `advisory`: each stage review becomes one pass whose findings the human reads at the gate; `none`: no stage reviewer is dispatched in the gated flow |

- A matched proposal starts from its stock scope's values (from its `.md`; a
  missing ceremony line means `on`, a missing `review_cap` means
  `adversarial`). A value you or the human change applies to this piece of
  work only, since no scope file is written: the final validate-grid run
  echoes the values that differ from the stock scope the plan runs on as
  `creation_settings`, typed values the conductor turns into creation flags.
  Any value can change, reviews included: a review level set for the piece of
  work replaces its scope's ceiling.
- Validate the final grid with the chosen values and its route (`--matched
  <scope>` or `--custom`); either flag makes the five settings and the Guard
  Policy required, and the validator checks each against the words the scope
  loader accepts.
- For a custom grid, start from the validator's nearest stock scope. Either
  way, move a setting only when the entropy profile gives a reason, the same
  way a SKIP needs one:
  - `sensors`: keep on when verification entropy is MED or higher, the work
    is regulated, or later stages trace back to these artifacts. Off fits a
    throwaway spike or the lightest run, where nobody will check the artifacts
    against their sources.
  - `learnings`: keep on for work in a codebase the team will keep changing.
    Off fits a one-off change where the ritual costs more than it returns.
  - `summary_confirmation`: keep on when intent ambiguity or unresolved
    assumptions are MED or higher; reading the consolidated answers back is
    how a misunderstanding gets caught before generation. Off fits work whose
    answers are already unambiguous.
  - `plan_approval`: keep the value of the scope the plan runs on (the
    matched stock scope, or a custom plan's base scope). Never propose turning
    it off: the validator rejects off where that scope asks, because only the
    person turns plan approval off.
  - `review_cap`: `adversarial` when risk or verification entropy is HIGH or
    the work is regulated; `advisory` when both are MED or lower and the human
    will read the findings at the gate; `none` only when both are LOW and the
    change is small enough for the human to review directly.
- No value removes a gate, a required question, human-turn authority, or the
  audit trail; `plan_approval: off` removes only the plan stop, and a
  memory-held strict Guard Policy keeps it on. A global kill switch
  (`AIDLC_DISABLE_SENSORS=1`, `AIDLC_DISABLE_LEARNINGS=1`,
  `AIDLC_DISABLE_SUMMARY_CONFIRMATION=1`, `AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1`) still forces its ceremony off
  whatever the scope says. The validator names one that forces an `on` value
  off on this machine; mark that value in the gate row, since the scope stores
  `on` but the ceremony will not run until the switch is cleared.
- The human sees the five values as one gate row, and whatever they ask for
  there is done. A change keeps the route and applies to this piece of work;
  only lowering a matched proposal's Guard Policy makes it custom. Plan
  approval keeps the value of the scope the plan runs on: only the person
  turns it off. When they ask at the gate, in their own words, to skip plan
  approval, the harness records it and creation turns it off, so the proposal
  stays as it is. A plan the person saves as a scope stores the
  values in its frontmatter as `sensors:`, `learnings:`,
  `summary_confirmation:`, `plan_approval:`, and `review_cap:`.
- In-flight, the settings are not part of the recompose. Leave a settings
  request out of the stage delta and return `settingsChanges`, typed values
  the conductor shows on the gate and applies only on the human's approval;
  return only what the request asks for. The keys are `sensors`, `learnings`, and
  `summary_confirmation` (`on`/`off`), `plan_approval` (`on` only: the person
  turns it off in their own words), and `review` (`adversarial`/`advisory`/
  `none`). Full reviews on a capped scope is `"review": "adversarial"`; no
  stage changes. When `engine config get <key>` reports `from env
  AIDLC_DISABLE_<NAME>`, a kill switch on this machine overrides every
  setting: return no change and say in one line that it has to be removed
  outside the agent. Never look for where it is set; shell startup files,
  environment listings, and harness settings files can hold credentials.
  Never put command text in `settingsChanges` or `creationSettings`.

## Open questions

A vague request costs twice when it is scored alone: high Intent Ambiguity
keeps discovery stages in the grid, and those stages then ask the person the
questions anyway. `openQuestions` asks the few that decide the grid before
anything runs, at most three, each naming what its answer flips.

| Ask | Do not ask |
|-----|------------|
| "Does this change touch any screen the user sees?" when user-stories and refined-mockups hinge on it | "What framework does the project use?" when the scan names it |
| "Does this need to ship anywhere, or is it local only?" when the deployment tail hinges on it | "Should reviews be on?" (the settings row covers it) |
| "Is this for one team or for outside customers?" when compliance or market stages hinge on it | Anything whose every answer leaves the grid as it is |

The grid stays complete without answers: decide each hinged stage on your best
reading and say in its rationale which question it rests on. The engine adds
the answers to the stored request, so they come back as part of the task text
and reach the created workflow's description, which is what lets later stages
skip the same question.

## Rationale quality

The gate is only as good as the rationale. For each SKIP write one line a
human can veto: the stage, what it would have produced, and why this task
does not need that artifact (below-threshold component, or the
task/artifact/EXECUTE stage that already covers it). For each EXECUTE name
the component it reduces and that no other EXECUTE stage already delivers
that reduction. "Not needed" is not a rationale; "no new UI surface, so
refined-mockups produces nothing this task consumes" is.
