// PreToolUse hook: deterministic enforcement of code-generation's
// plan-before-generation ordering (stage file Step 2-4).
//
// The stage prose says generation never begins before the human answers
// "Approve Plan": the conductor writes code-generation-plan.md, presents the
// Plan Approval question through code-generation-questions.md, and only an
// explicit approval authorizes the developer-agent dispatch. A field report
// showed prose losing that contest: a conductor generated the code first and
// backfilled the plan beside code-summary.md, making the plan an output
// instead of the input. The stage-completion artifact guard cannot catch
// this - it fires at completion time, when the backfilled plan already
// exists. Per the framework layering (determinism belongs in tools and
// hooks, knowledge in agents, judgement with humans), this hook is the
// ordering's deterministic twin.
//
// This is one of the framework's flow-altering hooks. Its contract is the
// harness-native PreToolUse block: print a reason to stderr and exit 2 to
// refuse the tool call, exit 0 to allow. The refusal is scoped tightly to
// code-generation: developer-agent dispatch and workspace mutation are both
// blocked until the same approval evidence is current. Writes inside the
// selected code-generation record dir remain available to create the plan,
// instructions, questions, and diary that make approval possible. So does the
// composer's grid proposal file, which a composition requested mid-stage writes.
//
// How the hook decides: the active directive is the approval authority. A
// directive with `unit` selects construction/<unit>/code-generation; a
// zero-Unit directive selects construction/code-generation. Step 4 dispatches
// carry that choice explicitly as `AIDLC-UNIT: <unit>` or
// `AIDLC-STAGE: code-generation`, plus the exact `AIDLC-TESTING-CONTRACT`
// marker. The selected target must have a non-empty plan and test instructions,
// a structured contract matching current memory/scope/strategy/type, an
// explicit "Approve Plan" answer, and a matching approval fingerprint over
// those exact bytes. Missing, conflicting, unknown, stale, and
// post-approval-modified evidence blocks instead of guessing.
//
// Fail-open outside code-generation: a missing or unreadable state file, an
// active directive/current stage other than code-generation, malformed stdin,
// an unknown/read-only tool, a non-developer subagent target, or any throw
// allows the call. Once a code-generation generation path is identified,
// missing or ambiguous target evidence blocks. The deterministic
// off-switch AIDLC_DISABLE_PLAN_APPROVAL_GUARD=1 disables enforcement (the
// documented escape hatch for false-positive storms, mirroring the
// reviewer-scope guard's off-switch) but is no longer silent: while a workflow
// exists it appends one GUARD_DISABLED audit row per streak of disabled calls.
// Every genuine block emits a PLAN_APPROVAL_BLOCKED audit event so the run's
// record shows when the ordering bit; audit failures never change the decision.
